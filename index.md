# Solid Start

Do you make digital things for other people? Awesome—because this page is all about making for people. There are four ways you can improve your creation for everybody. All four ways are testable, fixable and they improve usability for everybody.

<h2 id="four-things">Four improvements</h2>

There is one big assumption for a solid start. It assumes you know the basics of your tools. Validate your code.

<h3 id="keyboard">1. Keyboard</h3>

You are not building for you.
Not everybody uses a mouse, so you shouldn’t test with just a mouse. The most universal device to test with is a keyboard. A lot of people either use a keyboard, or use something that interacts with your creation like a keyboard.

Pressing the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key should take you to every interactive element in an intuitive order. Pressing <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd> should take you the opposite way. If you can reach **and** use every bit of functionality, you’re off to a good start.

Make sure it is clear which element is focused. People might feel lost when they don’t know where they are. 

<h3 id="contrast">2. Contrast</h3>

Contrast is essential. It can be hard to communicate if your content isn’t visible to people. 

There are many tools to measure contrast by providing a ratio. The [Color Contrast Analyser](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/) is used by a lot of people. You can also pick a tool from the [resources](#resources), or one that might already be inside your favorite environment. Each tool will give you a contrast ratio between two colors, like a foreground and background color. The visibility of a higher contrast ratio is better. Pure black and white can be too harsh for people.

User interface components and states should have a contrast ratio of at least **3:1**. Measure this ratio against their surrounding colors. The contrast ratio of large text (at least 24px, or at least 19px and bold) should be **3:1** or more. All other text should be at least **4.5:1**. These are minimum requirements, not goals.

<h3 id="alternatives">3. Alternatives</h3>

Ever tried to watch a movie in a busy place, or listen to a podcast without headphones? When you can’t see or hear, a text is a nice alternative to have! 

Offer captions for video. Offer a transcript for podcasts. For images, offer text alternatives. Text alternatives should convey the purpose of the image or the content of the image. A decorative image needs no alternative.

<h3 id="sizing">4. Sizing</h3>

Compare a mobile phone to a tablet, a laptop or a PC. No screen size is the same. Make sure that what you make offers the same content and functionality to all sizes. Let people experience it at whatever size they want or need.

<h2 id="inclusive-design">Inclusive Design</h2>

Congratulations! Follow these steps and you're helping a lot of people. 

This is also just a first step, and there’s more you can do. Want to know more about Inclusive Design and WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)? Check the [resources](#resources)!
